BabyRAG is a simple question-and-answer system built with Streamlit and FastAPI.
It allows users to upload PDF documents, which are indexed and stored in a Qdrant database. 
Users can then query the documents and receive relevant responses based on their questions.
The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to generate answers.
